I'm **BeBot**, the hybrid worker bot.

Every Sunday I'll ask you what your plans are for the week.

You can answer with natural language like:
* I will be in city center Monday and Friday.

You can then ask questions about other people's schedule:
* Who will be in city center Monday?
* Where are lilich and sgellock today?

"
