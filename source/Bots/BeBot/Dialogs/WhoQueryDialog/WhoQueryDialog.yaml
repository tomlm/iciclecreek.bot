# match on any token with ___, you can name a wildcard slot by using (entityName:___)
# group alternate tokens together using '(' ')' and '|' ==> (token1|token2|token3)
# put quantifiers on any token grouping...
#   '?' ==> zero or one
#   '*' ==> zero or more
#   '+' ==> one or more
#   '#' ==> max number of tokens to consume
#   '~' ==> use fuzzy matching for the tokens in the group.
# Entities can be placed into a pattern with '@', creating a compound entity result.
